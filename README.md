# ethereum-auth-demo
Demo of signing into a backend website from Web3 using JSON Web Tokens.

## Installation
    npm install
    browserify frontend.js > public/bundle.js

## How to use
1. Install MetaMask in Chrome / Chromium and create an Ethereum account.
2. Browse to localhost:3000. You should see information about the Ethereum network and your account address.
3. Click "Sign in". You will be prompted in MetaMask to sign the message "Sign into demo app."

## How does it work
* The Web3 environment (MetaMask / Mist) is requested to sign a message using the account's private key.
* The account address and the signed message are POSTed to the backend.
* The backend verifies that the signature is correct and generates a signed Json Web Token (JWT) proving that the holder is in control of the address.
